 * 
 *  This application is a game in which player(s) must escape from a prison
 *  by navigating through rooms, using items, completing quests, and
 *  engaging in combat with various enemies.
 *  
 *  This purpose of this class is to set up the game environment, which
 *  includes rooms, items, objects and NPCs that the player interacts with.
 *  
 *  This class also processes various commands which the player types into
 *  the console and links all of the other classes together.
